# gitHubPoc

1: Once user gives the gitHub url along with account and repo name it will fetch all the required details by calling gitHub apis.

The url should be like :   https://github.com/Shippable/{accountName}/{repoName}

2: The results display screen could be more dynamic like user can have multiple options or rules  to select.

3: For code sepeartion we could have used angularJS as javascript framewrok.

4: I have tried to follow the MVC principle in server side, but since data persistence was not required hence did not write services to 
    store the  data .
